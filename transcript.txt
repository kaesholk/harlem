Central Harlem is a neighborhood in northern Manhattan with a population of around 200,000 people and an area of 1.4 square miles. Harlem was founded as a Dutch village in 1658, built on the land of the Wecquaesgeek Native Americans. After being burned to the ground during the American Revolution, it developed gradually. After the Civil War, Harlem experienced an economic boom, with the construction of new rail lines linking it to Manhattan and the rest of New York. During this time, the demographics of the neighborhood began to shift away from the Jewish and Italian populations as more Black people migrated to Harlem. In 1910, Harlem was 10% Black, but had jumped to 70% by 1930 during the time of the Renaissance. In 1950, 98% of Harlemites were Black.
<br>The music scene was a particularly important part of Harlem’s culture. Countless (quote) “speakeasies, cellars, lounges, cafes, taverns, supper clubs, rib joints, theaters, dance halls, and bars and grills” (unquote) operated in Harlem, providing musicians and other performers with an outlet for creative expression and providing audiences with an endless stream of entertainment. Notable places include the Apollo Theater, the Savoy Ballroom, which helped popularize swing dancing, and the Cotton Club, Duke Ellington’s venue which was restricted to whites only. Many of these clubs were located on 133rd street, which became known as “Swing Street” because of its importance in the jazz scene.
<br>Today, there is still strong Black influence in Harlem, but the effects of gentrification have led to a decline in the Black population, decreasing 11% between 2000 and 2010. Meanwhile, the White population increased 402% in the same time period. The consequences of the segregation and redlining of Harlem are still present today, with some of the highest poverty rates in NYC being found in Harlem, as well as the worst public health. Despite the cultural erasure due to gentrification, the positive cultural influences of the Renaissance are still felt, and local activists are working to preserve Harlem’s unique culture and history.
